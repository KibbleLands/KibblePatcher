## The main goals

Be fun and easy to do and use :3

## How to use

If you get a "`Server is not a valid spigot server!`" make sure it's not a hybrid server 
*(Bukkit + Forge)*

1. Get you server.jar and KibblePatcher.jar *(You can use [Airplane](https://dl.airplane.gg/) as your server jar)*
2. Run the command `java -jar KibblePatcher.jar server.jar server-patched.jar`
3. Use the `server-patched.jar` as a normal server jar
4. Enjoy! :3

# Warning

**Warning:** Some people started spreading miss-leading reviews on different Discord servers,
except of the official support Discord, claiming KibblePatcher braking part of the server that 
KibblePatcher doesn't modify. Like breaking item pickup. (The patcher don't touch item pickup code,
and me and Vakea tested ourselves on different Minecraft versions to be sure the bug doesn't exist)
Real problems/issues of KibblePatcher are reported on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qgk4Saq)
or on [the issue section](https://github.com/KibbleLands/KibblePatcher/issues)

I take bug fixing, stability and compatibility very seriously.  

As of 15 March 2021 (Date when I'm writing this)  
I fixed all the reported bugs in KibblePatcher and just released 1.6.2,
and the last issue reported was the 19 February 2021 on Discord (24 day difference)
